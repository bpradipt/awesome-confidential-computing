# Awesome Confidential Computing

Collection of materials to help with the understanding of this fascinating technology.

## Big Picture

Confidential computing protects your workload from unauthorised entities â€” the host or hypervisor, system administrators, service providers, other VMs, and processes on the host.

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is at the heart of a confidential computing solution. TEEs are secure and isolated environments provided by confidential computing (CC) enabled hardware that prevents unauthorised access or modification of applications and data while in use

The following diagram provides a logical view of confidential computing solution. This can be used as a mental model to have a better understanding of the technology.
